# react-crypto-price-checker

This is Cryptocurrency price checker, built on React as an exercise of the course that I'm following at the moment.

This exercise includes features as:

- Creation of custom React Hook.
- Call to an external endpoint to get the latest information on Cryptocurrencies.
- Use of the library @emotion/styled to create some styled components.
- Use of CSS module to create a spinner, using the code from the website https://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/
